Class for sub-channel assignment

Sub-channel assignment is important in IEEE 802.11 wireless network since it can handle adjacent channel
interference. Take IEEE 802.11b wireless LANs operated on the 2.4GHz ISM band as an example, there are 14
sub-channels, however, some of them are overlapping, which will cause adjacent channel interference. This part of
work can be further extended to implement more advanced channel assignment algorithms, and support more access
technique like orthogonal frequency-division multiple access as well.

Attributes:
    simulator: the simulation platform that contains everything
    my_drone: the drone that installed this module
    mode: the IEEE 802.11 standard that adopted
    rng_channel_assignment: a Random class based on which we can call the function that generates the random number

Drone implementation

Drones in the simulation are served as routers. Each drone can be selected as a potential source node, destination
and relaying node. Each drone needs to install the corresponding routing module, MAC module, mobility module and
energy module, etc. At the same time, each drone also has its own queue and can only send one packet at a time, so
subsequent data packets need queuing for queue resources, which is used to reflect the queue delay in the drone
network

Attributes:
    simulator: the simulation platform that contains everything
    env: simulation environment created by simpy
    identifier: used to uniquely represent a drone
    coords: the 3-D position of the drone
    start_coords: the initial position of drone
    direction: current direction of the drone
    pitch: current pitch of the drone
    speed: current speed of the drone
    velocity: velocity components in three directions
    direction_mean: mean direction
    pitch_mean: mean pitch
    velocity_mean: mean velocity
    inbox: a "Store" in simpy, used to receive the packets from other drones (calculate SINR)
    buffer: used to describe the queuing delay of sending packet
    transmitting_queue: when the next hop node receives the packet, it should first temporarily store the packet in
                "transmitting_queue" instead of immediately yield "packet_coming" process. It can prevent the buffer
                resource of the previous hop node from being occupied all the time
    waiting_list: for reactive routing protocol, if there is no available next hop, it will put the data packet into
                  "waiting_list". Once the routing information bound for a destination is obtained, drone will get
                  the data packets related to this destination, and put them into "transmitting_queue"
    mac_protocol: installed mac protocol (CSMA/CA, ALOHA, etc.)
    mac_process_dict: a dictionary, used to store the mac_process that is launched each time
    mac_process_finish: a dictionary, used to indicate the completion of the process
    mac_process_count: used to distinguish between different "mac_send" processes
    enable_blocking: describe whether the process of waiting for an ACK blocks the delivery of subsequent packets
                     1: stop-and-wait protocol; 0: sliding window (need further implemented)
    routing_protocol: routing protocol installed (GPSR, DSDV, etc.)
    mobility_model: mobility model installed (3-D Gauss-markov, 3-D random waypoint, etc.)
    energy_model: energy consumption model installed
    residual_energy: the residual energy of drone in Joule
    sleep: if the drone is in a "sleep" state, it cannot perform packet sending and receiving operations
    channel_assigner: used to assign sub-channel for transmitting

**方法：**

- `__init__(self, env, node_id, coords, speed, inbox, simulator)` (line 67)
        - 调用：ChannelAssigner, CsmaCa, Dsdv, EnergyModel, GaussMarkov3D, dict, math.cos, math.sin, queue.Queue, random.Random, self.env.process, self.feed_packet, self.generate_data_packet, self.receive, self.rng_drone.uniform, simpy.Resource
- `generate_data_packet(self, traffic_pattern)` (line 121)

    Generate one data packet, it should be noted that only when the current packet has been sent can the next
    packet be started. When the drone generates a data packet, it will first put it into the "transmitting_queue",
    the drone reads a data packet from the head of the queue every very short time through "feed_packet()" function.

    参数：
        traffic_pattern: characterize the time interval between generating data packets
        - 调用：DataPacket, all_candidate_list.remove, logger.info, range, round, self.channel_assigner.channel_assign, self.env.timeout, self.rng_drone.choice, self.rng_drone.expovariate, self.rng_drone.randint, self.transmitting_queue.put, self.transmitting_queue.qsize
- `blocking(self)` (line 190)

    The process of waiting for an ACK will block subsequent incoming data packets to simulate the
    "head-of-line blocking problem"
        - 调用：list, self.mac_protocol.wait_ack_process_finish.items
- `feed_packet(self)` (line 212)

    It should be noted that this function is designed for those packets which need to compete for wireless channel

    Firstly, all packets received or generated will be put into the "transmitting_queue", every very short
    time, the drone will read the packet in the head of the "transmitting_queue". Then the drone will check
    if the packet is expired (exceed its maximum lifetime in the network), check the type of packet:
    1) data packet: check if the data packet exceeds its maximum re-transmission attempts. If the above inspection
       passes, routing protocol is executed to determine the next hop drone. If next hop is found, then this data
       packet is ready to transmit, otherwise, it will be put into the "waiting_queue".
    2) control packet: no need to determine next hop, so it will directly start waiting for buffer
        - 调用：isinstance, logger.info, self.blocking, self.env.process, self.env.timeout, self.packet_coming, self.remove_from_queue, self.routing_protocol.next_hop_selection, self.transmitting_queue.empty, self.transmitting_queue.get, self.waiting_list.append
- `packet_coming(self, pkd)` (line 262)

    When drone has a packet ready to transmit, yield it.

    The requirement of "ready" is:
        1) this packet is a control packet, or
        2) the valid next hop of this data packet is obtained

    Parameter:
        pkd: packet that waits to enter the buffer of drone
        - 调用：join, logger.info, self.buffer.request, self.env.process, self.mac_protocol.mac_send, str
- `remove_from_queue(self, data_pkd)` (line 308)

    After receiving the ack packet, drone should remove the data packet that has been acked from its queue

    Parameter:
        data_pkd: the acked data packet
        - 调用：queue.Queue, self.transmitting_queue.empty, self.transmitting_queue.get, self.transmitting_queue.put, temp_queue.empty, temp_queue.get, temp_queue.put
- `receive(self)` (line 325)

    Core receiving function of drone
    1. the drone checks its "inbox" to see if there is incoming packet every 5 units (in us) from the time it is
       instantiated to the end of the simulation
    2. update the "inbox" by deleting the inconsequential data packet
    3. then the drone will detect if it receives a (or multiple) complete data packet(s)
    4. SINR calculation
        - 调用：has_intersection, list, logger.info, max, pkd.get_current_ttl, self.env.process, self.env.timeout, self.routing_protocol.packet_reception, self.trigger, self.update_inbox, sinr_calculator, sinr_list.index, transmitting_node_list.append, tuple
- `update_inbox(self)` (line 388)

    Clear the packets that have been processed.

                          |==========|←- (current incoming packet p1)
                   |==========|←- (packet p2 that has been processed, but also can affect p1, so reserve it)
    |==========|←- (packet p3 that has been processed, no impact on p1, can be deleted)
    --------------------------------------------------------> time
        - 调用：self.inbox.remove
- `trigger(self)` (line 411)

    Detects whether the drone has received a complete data packet

    返回：
        flag: bool variable, "1" means a complete data packet has been received by this drone and vice versa

Medium access control protocol: CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Avoidance) without RTS/CTS

The basic flow of the basic CSMA/CA (without RTS/CTS) is as follows:
    1) when a node has a packet to send, it first needs to wait until the channel is idle
    2) when the channel is idle, the node starts a timer and waits for "DIFS+backoff" periods of time, where the
       length of backoff is related to the number of re-transmissions
    3) if the entire decrement of the timer to 0 is not interrupted, then the node can occupy the channel and start
       sending the data packet and waiting for the corresponding ACK
    4) if the countdown is interrupted, it means that the node loses the game. The node should freeze the timer and
       wait for channel idle again before re-starting its timer

Main attributes:
    my_drone: the drone that installed the CSMA/CA protocol

    rng_mac: a Random class based on which we can call the function that generates the random number
    env: simulation environment created by simpy

**文档字符串：**

```
Pure ALOHA protocol

This protocol allows devices to transmit packet at any time, without a set schedule. After transmitting a packet,
the drone should wait for the ACK packet. If it fails to receive the corresponding ACK packet after a period of time,
the drone will simply wait a random amount of time before attempting to transmit again.

The basic flow of the Pure ALOHA is as follows:
    1) when a node has a packet to send, it just sends it, without listening to the channel and random backoff
    2) after sending the packet, the node starts to wait for the ACK
    3) if it receives ACK, the mac_send process will finish
    4) if not, the node will wait a random amount of time, according to the number of re-transmissions attempts

3-D Gauss-Markov Mobility Model

In this memorized model, the trajectory and velocity of the next motion at any time and any position
depends on its previous position and velocity vector. There are three main parameters: 1) The first parameter
is to determine how often the drone updates its position, velocity and other information, the denser this time
interval is, the higher the simulation accuracy. 2) The second parameter is to determine how often the drone
changes its velocity, direction, and other information. The smaller the interval is, the drone will change its
motion direction frequently. 3) The last parameter is to control the randomness of the mobility.

3-D Random walk mobility model

In this model, firstly, the drone will randomly choose a direction of motion, and move along this direction for a
fixed amount of time ("travel_duration"). In addition to this, it is also possible to specify the drone to move a
fixed distance in this direction. In this code, we assume that the speed of drone is constant.

Attributes:
    my_drone: the drone which installs this mobility model
    move_counter
    position_update_interval: in us, determine how often the drone updates its position
    travel_duration: specifies the time for a node to move in a certain direction

3-D Random Waypoint Mobility Model

In this mobility model, the waypoint of drone will be generated in advance. Then drone will visit these waypoints
in order. When the drone reached the waypoint, it will pause for a while, and then start heading down to the next
waypoint. Normally, we will set up multiple waypoints as many as possible to prevent the drone visiting all the
waypoints before the simulation is finished.

all the other nodes in the network have received a copy of the update packet.

**文档字符串：**

```
Main procedure of GRAd (Gradient Routing in ad hoc networks) (v1.0)

Slight changes have been made to the original paper:
On transmitting data packet:
1) When a drone wishes to send a data packet to a destination for which the cost to the target is known, it will
   embed the data packet in "GradMessage" with the "msg_type" filed set to "M_DATA", and then broadcast
2) When a drone wishes to send a data packet to another drone for which there is no entry in the cost table, it
   initiates a request process. Similarly, the originator drone will transmit "GradMessage" whose "msg_type" filed
   is set to "M_REQUEST", specifying the destination in the "target_id", initializing the "remaining_value" field
   to "default_request_cost", "accrued_cost" field to "0", and then broadcast

On receiving packet:
Some important things that every receiving drone must do:
1) When the drone receives a message from its neighbor, it debits the "remaining_value" field by one and increases
   the "accrued_cost" by one
2) update its cost table according to the incoming message

Other type-related procedures:
1) if "msg_type" field is "M_DATA", before reaching the destination, only those drones with a lower cost than the
   "remain_value" in the message can further forward
2) if "msg_type" field is "M_REQUEST", when I am the "target drone", reply message should be launched. For other
   drones, they will always relay the first copy of the message they receive, unless the "remaining_value" field
   has reached zero
3) if "msg_type" field is "M_REPLY", when I am the "target drone" of this reply message, it means that now I know
   the routing information of the data packets stored in my "waiting_list". Therefore, all data packets destined for
   the originator of REPLY message in "waiting_list" are taken out and put into the "transmitting_queue". For other
   drones, only those drones with a lower cost than the "remain_value" in the REPLY message can further forward

### 类 `GradCostTable`（行 4）
**文档字符串：**

```
Cost table of GRAd (Gradient Routing in ad hoc networks) (v1.0)

Type of the cost table: dictionary
the format of the cost table is:
{target_id 1: [seq_#, est_cost1, updated time1], target_id 2: [seq_#, est_cost2, updated time2],...}
Explanation:
1) "target_id": is the identifier of a remote drone to which this cost entry refers
2) "seq_#": the highest sequence number received so far in a message from "target_id". When compared against the
    seq_# of a newly arrived message, this field discriminates between a new message and a copy of a previously
    received message
3) "est_cost": the most recent and best estimated cost (number of hops in this version) for delivering a message
    to "target_id"
4) "updated time": this field is used to determine if the entry is expired

The cost table can answer two question:
1) "Is this message a copy of a previously received message?" This is determined by comparing the sequence number
    in the incoming message against the last sequence number recorded in the cost table
2) "What is the estimated cost of sending a message to a certain target drone?" In cost table, each "target_id" is
    associated with "est_cost"

Main procedure of Greedy Forwarding

In greedy forwarding approach, packets are forwarded to the neighbor located closest to the destination at each hop.
Greedy routing is highly efficient for the route discovery process, however, the problem of local minimum will
significantly limit its performance. Users can extend it by adding some recovery mechanism to improve the
performance.

Attributes:
    simulator: the simulation platform that contains everything
    my_drone: the drone that installed the greedy routing
    rng_routing: a Random class based on which we can call the function that generates the random number
    hello_interval: interval of sending hello packet
    neighbor_table: neighbor table of greedy routing

```
Main procedure of Q-routing

The core idea of this protocol is using Q-learning to approximate the end-to-end delay of packet transmission.
The update of Q-values was implemented by ACK packet. It should be noted that the implementation in this project is
sightly different from the original paper regrading to the calculation of transmission delay "s", because in highly
dynamic network, the reply of ACK packet will fail due to many different factors.

Calculation example:
For a drone "x", it has a data packet bound for destination "d", after checking its Q-table, it selects its neighbor
drone "y" with minimum Q-value Q_x(d, y) as the next hop. Then drone "x" transmits this data packet to "y". When "y"
receives the data packet from "x", it will reply an ACK packet to "x", which carries serval information listed below:
1. t = min Q_y(d, z): represents drone y's estimation for the time remaining in the trip.
2. q: queuing delay in drone "x"

When drone "x" receives the ACK packet from "y", it first calculates the real transmission delay "s" (Note that one
cannot simply divide the data packet length by the bit rate, as re-transmission may also be included). Then drone
"x" updates the Q-value of "y" using the following formula:

Q_x(d, y) <-- (1 - a) * Q_x(d, y) + a * (q + s + t)

In a nutshell, the protocol proposed in this paper can be considered as a kind of online learning protocol, where
each drone can interact with its neighbors and updates its policy online. No replay buffer and each drone should
maintain its own Q-table. However, if the topology of the network changes rapidly, the learning speed will be a
problem. Besides, the update mechanism by ACK may be unsatisfactory in the situation of bad channel condition.

Attributes:
    simulator: the simulation platform that contains everything
    my_drone: the drone that installed the Q-routing
    rng_routing: a Random class based on which we can call the function that generates the random number
    hello_interval: interval of sending hello packet
    learning_rate: used to guide the degree to which the Q-value is updated
    table: including neighbor table and Q-table

```
Tools for statistics of network performance

1. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR): is the ratio of number of packets received at the destinations to the number
   of packets sent from the sources
2. Average end-to-end (E2E) delay: is the time a packet takes to route from a source to its destination through
   the network. It is the time the data packet reaches the destination minus the time the data packet was generated
   in the source node
3. Routing Load: is calculated as the ratio between the numbers of control Packets transmitted
   to the number of packets actually received. NRL can reflect the average number of control packets required to
   successfully transmit a data packet and reflect the efficiency of the routing protocol
4. Throughput: it can be defined as a measure of how fast the data is sent from its source to its intended
   destination without loss. In our simulation, each time the destination receives a data packet, the throughput is
   calculated and finally averaged
5. Hop count: used to record the number of router output ports through which the packet should pass.
